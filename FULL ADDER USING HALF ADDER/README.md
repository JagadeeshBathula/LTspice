# FULL ADDER USING HALF ADDERS

## ✅ Overview

A Full Adder adds three inputs: A, B, and Cin (Carry In), and produces two outputs: Sum and Cout (Carry Out). The Boolean equations are:

Sum = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin

Cout = (A ⋅ B) + (Cin ⋅ (A ⊕ B))

We’ll use two Half Adders:

First Half Adder: Adds A and B → produces Sum1 = A ⊕ B, Carry1 = A ⋅ B

Second Half Adder: Adds Sum1 and Cin → produces Sum = Sum1 ⊕ Cin, Carry2 = Sum1 ⋅ Cin

Final Cout = Carry1 + Carry2

## 🛠 Step-by-Step LTspice Design

### Step 1: Design Basic Gates

Before building a Half Adder, you need to design:

XOR gate

AND gate

OR gate

You can use CMOS transistor-level designs or behavioral logic gates using *.subckt definitions. Let's proceed with behavioral modeling (for simplicity).

Option 1: Behavioral Logic Using Voltage Sources and Vswitch

Or

Option 2: Use .subckt macros for gates (recommended)

Step 2: Create Half Adder Subcircuit

A Half Adder has:

Inputs: A, B

Outputs: Sum (A ⊕ B), Carry (A ⋅ B)

Create a subcircuit like:

* Half Adder Subcircuit
  
.subckt HALF_ADDER A B SUM CARRY

X1 A B XOR1 SUM  ; XOR gate

X2 A B AND1 CARRY ; AND gate

.ends HALF_ADDER

Step 3: Create Full Adder Using Two Half Adders

* Full Adder Using Two Half Adders
  
.subckt FULL_ADDER A B Cin SUM Cout

* Internal nets
  
.node SUM1 C1 C2

* First Half Adder
  
XHA1 A B SUM1 C1 HALF_ADDER

* Second Half Adder
  
XHA2 SUM1 Cin SUM C2 HALF_ADDER

* OR gate for Cout
  
XOR1 C1 C2 Cout

.ends FULL_ADDER

Step 4: Top-Level Testbench in LTspice

* Testbench

VinCin Cin 0 PULSE(0 2 2 0.001 0.001 2 4)

##✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a Full Adder can be constructed using two Half Adders in LTspice. By breaking down the logic into reusable components and simulating them, we gain practical insights into digital logic design and circuit behavior. It’s a great example of modular design and verification using simulation tools.
