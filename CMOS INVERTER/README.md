# CMOS INVERTER
This repository contains the design, simulation, and analysis of a CMOS Inverter — a fundamental building block in digital electronics. It demonstrates how complementary MOSFETs (PMOS and NMOS) work together to implement digital logic.

## 📌 Project Overview

A CMOS Inverter uses a PMOS transistor connected to VDD and an NMOS transistor connected to GND. When the input is high, the NMOS conducts and pulls the output low; when the input is low, the PMOS conducts and pulls the output high. This configuration offers:

* Low static power consumption

* High noise margins

* Full rail-to-rail output voltage swing
