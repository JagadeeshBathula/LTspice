# CMOS NOR

CMOS NOR (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor NOR) is a digital logic gate implemented using CMOS technology that performs the NOR (NOT OR) operation. 
A NOR gate logic gate that outputs true (1) only when all inputs are false (0). It is the combination of an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.

## ðŸ§ª Step-by-Step Design: CMOS NOR Gate in LTspice

âœ… Goal

Design a 2-input CMOS NOR gate using:

Two PMOS transistors in series

Two NMOS transistors in parallel

1. Start LTspice and Create a New Schematic

Open LTspice

Go to File â†’ New Schematic

Save your file with a name like cmos_nor.asc

2. Place Components

Press F2 to open the component selector. You will need the following:

a. PMOS Transistors (2x)

Search: pmos

Select the default pmos symbol

Place two PMOS transistors in series

Source of top PMOS â†’ VDD

Drain of top PMOS â†’ source of bottom PMOS

Drain of bottom PMOS â†’ output node

b. NMOS Transistors (2x)

Search: nmos

Select the default nmos symbol

Place two NMOS transistors in parallel

Both sources â†’ GND

Both drains â†’ output node

c. Voltage Sources (3x)

Search: voltage

Place:

VDD (e.g., 2v) â†’ power supply

V_A and V_B â†’ inputs A and B

d. Ground

Press G or choose from the toolbar to place GND

Connect all grounds

Connect VDD to the source of the top PMOS

Tie all GND references together

PMOS Series Network:

Connect drain of bottom PMOS to output node

Connect gate of each PMOS to input signals A and B

NMOS Parallel Network:

Connect both drains to output node

Connect sources to ground

Connect gate of each NMOS to inputs A and B

4. Label Important Nodes

Use the label tool (F4) to label:

Inputs: A, B

Output: Y

VDD: VDD

5. Set Up Input Pulses

Double-click V_A and V_B, set the source type to PULSE.

 PULSE settings 
 
 for V_A:

PULSE(0 2 4 0.001 0.001 4 8)

 for V_B:

PULSE(0 2 2 0.001 0.001 2 4)

These create square waves to test all input combinations (00, 01, 10, 11).

7. Set Up Simulation

Add a .tran command:

Go to Edit â†’ Spice Directive

.tran 8

Place the directive on your schematic.

8. Run the Simulation
Click the Run (Man Running) icon

## truth table

| Input A |	Input B	|	NOR Output (A + B)` |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
|    0    |   0     |		      1           |
|    0    | 	1     |     		0           |
|    1    |  	0  	  |       	0           |
|    1    |  	1     |     		0           |
