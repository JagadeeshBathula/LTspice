# HALF ADDER

### 🧠 What is a Half Adder?

A Half Adder is a combinational logic circuit that adds two binary digits and produces:

Sum (A ⊕ B) → XOR

Carry (A · B) → AND

### Step-by-Step Design in LTspice

1. Open LTspice
   
Launch the LTspice application.

Create a new schematic: File → New Schematic.

2. Insert XOR and AND gates
   
LTspice doesn't include built-in logic gates by default, but you can:

Use behavioral expressions.

Use subcircuits (if you’ve created XOR/AND gates previously).

Use behavioral sources:

Press F2 → Select Voltage for input signals.

Press F2 → Add BV (Behavioral Voltage Source) for logic.

3. Add Input Voltages
 
Place two voltage sources V1 and V2 to act as input A and B.

Set them as pulse generators for simulation.

Example (for A):

Right-click → Advanced → select PULSE

Vinitial: 0

Von: 5  

TD: 0  

TR: 0.001

TF: 0.001

PW: 4

PER: 8

Use same for B, but with different delay to get all input combinations.

4. Implement Logic Using Behavioral Expressions

   Take the components

   XOR , AND

6. Connect Circuit

   
Connect input sources to named nets (A, B).

Connect BV sources to get Sum and Carry.

Ground all appropriate points.

6. Run Simulation

Add .tran 8

 command for transient simulation.

Click Run → View Sum and Carry waveforms.

## 🔢 Truth Table: Half Adder

| Input A | Input B | Sum (A ⊕ B) | Carry (A · B) |
|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|
|    0    |    0    |      0       |       0        |
|    0    |    1    |      1       |       0        |
|    1    |    0    |      1       |       0        |
|    1    |    1    |      0       |       1        |

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the fundamental design of a Half Adder using LTspice. By combining simple voltage sources and behavioral modeling, users can visualize and understand how binary addition works at the logic gate level. The project is modular, extendable, and serves as a solid foundation for deeper explorations into digital circuit design, such as Full Adders, ripple-carry adders, and ALUs.

Whether you're a student, engineer, or hobbyist, this simulation offers a hands-on approach to learning binary arithmetic and logic gate interactions using an industry-standard simulation tool.
