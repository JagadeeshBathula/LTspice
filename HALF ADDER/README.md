# HALF ADDER

### 🧠 What is a Half Adder?

A Half Adder is a combinational logic circuit that adds two binary digits and produces:

Sum (A ⊕ B) → XOR

Carry (A · B) → AND

### Step-by-Step Design in LTspice

1. Open LTspice
   
Launch the LTspice application.

Create a new schematic: File → New Schematic.

2. Insert XOR and AND gates
   
LTspice doesn't include built-in logic gates by default, but you can:

Use behavioral expressions.

Use subcircuits (if you’ve created XOR/AND gates previously).

Use behavioral sources:

Press F2 → Select Voltage for input signals.

Press F2 → Add BV (Behavioral Voltage Source) for logic.

3. Add Input Voltages
 
Place two voltage sources V1 and V2 to act as input A and B.

Set them as pulse generators for simulation.

Example (for A):

Right-click → Advanced → select PULSE

Vinitial: 0

Von: 5  

TD: 0  

TR: 0.001

TF: 0.001

PW: 4

PER: 8

Use same for B, but with different delay to get all input combinations.

4. Implement Logic Using Behavioral Expressions

   Take the components

   XOR , AND

6. Connect Circuit

   
Connect input sources to named nets (A, B).

Connect BV sources to get Sum and Carry.

Ground all appropriate points.

6. Run Simulation

Add .tran 8

 command for transient simulation.

Click Run → View Sum and Carry waveforms.
